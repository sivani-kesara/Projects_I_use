# File Organizer
## Overview
This Python script organizes files within a specified folder by grouping them into subfolders based on their file extensions.
## How it works
The script performs the following steps:
1. Retrieves all files within the specified folder.
2. Identifies the file extension of each file.
3. Creates subfolders corresponding to each unique file extension.
4. Moves files to their respective subfolders based on their extensions.
## How to use
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the script.
3. Modify the `folder_path` variable in the script to point to the folder you want to organize.
4. Run the script. It will automatically organize the files within the specified folder.
## Example
Suppose you have a folder named "Documents" containing various files. Running this script on "Documents" will organize files into subfolders like:
- "Documents/pdf_files"
- "Documents/docx_files"
- "Documents/png_files"
...and so on, based on the file extensions present.
